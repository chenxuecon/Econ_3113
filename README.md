# Intermediate Microeconomics -- Summer 2019
This repository contains the instruction materials for an Intermediate Microeconomics course taught at the University of Oklahoma during Summer 2019. Other course files, such as quizzes and tests, can be requested as needed. 

Since this was taught during a summer session, the lecture slides are more condensed than a typical Intermediate Micro course. Adjustments should be made in the future based on looser time constraints.
